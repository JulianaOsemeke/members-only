# members-only

- This project entails building a members-only app. The author of posts are kept secret unless logged
- In this project, we built an exclusive clubhouse where  members can write anonymous posts. 
- Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Built With
